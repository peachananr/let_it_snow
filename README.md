Note: This plugin is based on [Jason Brown](https://github.com/loktar00)'s solution [found here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13983764/creating-falling-snow-using-html-5-and-js)


## Demo

## Compatibility
Modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on both desktop and smartphones have been tested. I have not tested this on IE.

## Basic Usage
Let it Snow is a little plugin that is based off the solution of creating a snow effect with HTNL5 Canvas by Jason Brown. I decided to extend its functionality so that developer will have a full control of how the animation of snow will react.

To add this to your website, simply include the latest jQuery library together with `jquery.let_it_snow.js` into your document's `<head>`, and simply call the function like this:

````javascript
$("canvas").let_it_snow({
  speed: 0, // How fast the snow falls can be define here. You can choose a number in between 0 - 5. The higher, the faster. The default value is 0.
  interaction: true, // This option allows viewer to interact with the falling snow. Toggle this to false if you don't want the snow to be interactive. The default value is true.
  size: 2, // You can set the size of the snow here. Choose a number between 0 - 10+. The higher, the bigger. The default size is 2.
  count: 200, // This allows you to set the number of snows displayed at a time. The default count is 200.
  opacity: 0, // The opacity variation of the snow. You can choose a number in between 0.00 and 1.00 to set the base opacity and the plugin will randomly generate snows with slightly varied opacity.
  color: "#ffffff", // You can set the color of the snow here. This option only accepts HEX color code in full 6 digits. The default value is "#ffffff"
  windPower: 0, // You can set the wind power here. If you want the wind to blow left, set a positive number in this option., if you want the wind to blow right, set a negative number in this option. The default value is 0.
  image: false // You can define a path to an image to be used instead of a default circle here. The default value is false.
});
````

If you want to change an option after inititing `let_it_snow` plugin you can trigger `letItSnow.set` event passing two arguments in the second parameter array: `["optionName", "optionValue"]`:

````javascript
$("canvas").trigger("letItSnow.set", ["windPower", 13]);
````

And that's all for this plugin. Stay tuned for more updates.
